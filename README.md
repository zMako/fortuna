🎟️ | Fortuna is revolutionizing the lottery market by introducing a fully decentralized, community-hosted, negative house edge lottery system. 

🔗 | DECENTRALIZED LOTTERY - Our lottery system runs on Binance Smart Chain providing full decentralization

💁 | COMMUNITY-HOSTED - The lottery is hosted fully by the community, anyone can initiate a draw every two days after random number is provided

✅ | VERIFIABLY RANDOM - Winners are selected using numbers provided by Chainlink VRF V2 along with cryptographic proof that anyone can verify

🏠 | NEGATIVE HOUSE EDGE - 100% of what players commit goes straight to the lottery pool. Additionally, a part of transaction fee is also committed achieving negative house edge.

📈 | AUTOMATED LIQUIDITY ACQUISITION - To provide stability to the token price, half of the transaction fee goes straight to the liquidity pool (half as WBNB, half as token)

🪞 | REFLECTION V2 - We also introduce a new reflection algorithm which supports holders and active players, discouraging harmful speculation on token prices.

🤨 | TRUSTLESS SMART CONTRACT - The smart contract is implemented in a transparent, verifiable way. Owner has very limited power over the token.

🪙 | DEFLATIONARY TOKEN - Part of each transaction is burned to reduce the total supply over time, which additionally supports active participants and holders while limiting speculation.

✅ | We truly believe that our project is a disruptive innovation, and has a great potential. You can read more about our functions, prospects, roadmap and everything about our project at our website: https://fortunaproject.net/home

We are launching on PancakeSwap at 9th July 2022, at 8PM UTC.
