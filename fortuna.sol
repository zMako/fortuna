      transaction being reflected, it starts to make slight difference to get reflections on reflections when you hold over 0.1% of the total supply and the whole 
      supply of the token gets moved, but then rewards you make on reflections on reflections will be less than the gas fees you spend on the transaction, so the problem
      with users transacting to get reflections on reflections gaining unfair advantage naturally resolves itself.
